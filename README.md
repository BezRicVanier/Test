Hello World! My name is Richard, and I am a student in Canada. I am interested in both the physical and language aspects of programming, and I have expereince working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, as well as languages such as C# and more basic languages such as Turing and Pascal. I aspire to learn more about coding and use my knowledge to help me in my future higher education and career.I like programming becuase it gives me the freedom to use creative solutions to solve problems and acheive tasks. I enjoy the thrill of coming to a solution or getting a program to work after I have been working on it for a long time. While I enjoy programming, sometimes I can get frustrated by the need to go back and put things like error trapping or comments into code that would otherwise work fine without it, often becuase I simply forget to put it there in the first place.
